# Excel Record Automation using Python Scripts

## 📌 Project Overview
This project automates the process of linking employee-specific `.docx` files to their corresponding records in an Excel sheet. By matching **Unique Number** and **Name** fields, the script dynamically generates hyperlinks that directly point to the correct documents located in a designated directory.

The tool is designed to minimize manual work, enhance data accessibility, and ensure document consistency — ideal for HR teams, operations departments, or any environment dealing with large-scale employee documentation.
